<h1>Latches</h1>
<p>A latch is fundamental element in sequential ciruits. It stores 1-bit of information. One can refers this operation 
as "Latching" similar to that of storing. The excitation table depicts the functioning of the NOR Latch.</p>

 			<p>As we can see in Fig 1.1 the structure of a Latch composed of two NOR gates, one of the univeral gates.
			The two feedback paths is what makes it a memory element. Thus, circuitary
			of a digital systems consists of such elements and can have several feedback paths. 
			The excitation table depicts the functioning of the NOR Latch.
			</p>
 		 <p>When S(set-input) and R(reset-input) are '0' the Latch will retain its previous state i.e. Q(n), hence functioning as a "Memory". When the input, SET = '1', output is set to '1' as soon as RESET remains '0' and ouput gets reset or made clear - '0' when RESET = '1'.
 		Further, if we try and set both input to '1', the latch will go into "Meta-Stable State". It's an unexpected result.</p>
