		<h2><li>Registers:</li></h2>
		<div class="row">
<p>A register is a collection of a set of flip flops used to store a set of bits. For instance, if you want to store an N â€“ bit of words you need N number of FFS. AFF can store only one bit of data (0 or 1). A number of FFs are used when the number of data bits to be stored. A register is a set of FFs used to store binary data. The data storage capacity of a register is a set of bits of digital data that it can retain. Loading a register can be defined as setting or resetting the separate FFs, i.e, giving data into the register so the status of the FF communicates to the bits of data to be stored.</p>

<h2><li>RAM (Random Access Memory):</li></h2>
<p>RAM is used in computers, information processing systems, digital control systems it is necessary to store digital data and recover the data as preferred. FFS can be used to make memories in which information can be stored for any required length of time and then deliver whenever required.</p>

<h2><li>Counters:</li></h2>
<p>In digital logic and computing, a counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, often in relationship to a clock. The most common type is a sequential digital logic circuit with an input line called the clock and multiple output lines. The values on the output lines represent a number in the binary or BCD number system. Each pulse applied to the clock input increments or decrements the number in the counter.

<p>
A state machine is a digital device that traverses through a predetermined sequence of states in an orderly fash- ion. A state is a set of values measured at different parts of the circuit. A simple state machine can consist of PAL- device based combinatorial logic, output registers, and buried (state) registers.
